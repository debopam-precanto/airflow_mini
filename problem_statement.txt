Problem Statement
Design and implement a minimal workflow orchestration system (similar in spirit to Airflow, but much smaller).
The system should allow defining workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), executing tasks while respecting dependencies, handling failures with retries, persisting state, exposing a Web API, supporting authentication, and executing tasks across multiple local worker processes.
This exercise encourages the use of agentic coding tools / AI coding assistants to improve development throughput and to demonstrate effective usage of such tools during real system-building.

Core Requirements
Your system must support the following capabilities.

1. Workflow (DAG) Definition
Each workflow contains tasks.
Each task has:
id (string)


command (shell command or executable function)


dependencies (list of task ids)


max_retries (integer)


Example:
{
  "id": "example_workflow",
  "tasks": [
    { "id": "A", "command": "echo A", "dependencies": [] },
    { "id": "B", "command": "echo B", "dependencies": ["A"] },
    { "id": "C", "command": "echo C", "dependencies": ["A"] },
    { "id": "D", "command": "echo D", "dependencies": ["B", "C"] }
  ]
}


2. Task States
At minimum:
PENDING


RUNNING


SUCCESS


FAILED


RETRYING



3. Scheduler
The scheduler should:
Identify runnable tasks


Dispatch tasks for execution


Track state transitions


Apply retries





4. Parallel Execution
Independent tasks must execute in parallel.



5. Local Multi-Node Workers
Tasks must be executed by separate worker processes (or services) running locally.


Scheduler should dispatch work to workers using an explicit protocol (e.g., HTTP, RPC, message queue, etc.).


Workers report task completion/failure back to scheduler.



6. Persistence
The following must survive process restart:
Workflow definitions


Workflow runs


Task states


You may use:
SQLite


Local file storage


Embedded database


Any simple persistence mechanism




7. Web API
Expose minimal HTTP endpoints (design is up to you), for example:
Register workflow


Trigger workflow run


Get workflow status


Get task status


No UI is required.

8. Authentication (Not Authorization)
API endpoints must require authentication.


Simple mechanisms are acceptable (e.g., API key, static token, basic auth, etc.).


No role-based authorization is required.



Explicit Non-Goals
Do not implement:
UI


Visualization


Plugin system


Distributed cluster across machines


Authorization / RBAC
Single-machine deployment is sufficient.

Optional Enhancements (If Time Permits)
Cancel workflow run


Pause / resume


Task timeout


Structured logging


Basic metrics


Optional.

Notes on Tool Usage
Using AI coding assistants / agentic tools is encouraged.
The focus is on:
How you break down the problem


How you interact with tools


How you validate outputs


How you integrate and refine generated code


There is no expectation to limit tool usage.
